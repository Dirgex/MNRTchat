Realtime chat using React,ExpressJs and pusher

Need to setup own pusher account and set keys in .env in both server and client

Client
PUSHERKEY="yourkeyhere"

Server
APP_ID = "yourkeyhere"
KEY = "yourkeyhere"
SECRET = "yourkeyhere"

Installation

npm install in both client and server

check so your 3001 port is free

npx nodemon index.js while you are on server

npm start while on client
